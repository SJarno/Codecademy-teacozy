# Codecademy-teacozy
## About
Just for practice. I've never really been very good with plain html and css, so this is a simple practice project I picked up at Codacademy.

The original specs can be found here: https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg

Just some simple layouts, and css flexbox training.

## Features
- Went mobile first, and table and laptop next
- Lastly I added media only for my own lapto screen, which is quite large
- The flexbox breaks up at certain points. But the main object is done, so I probably wont be updating this anymore.
